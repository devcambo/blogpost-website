# Blogpost-Website
This is a simple blog post website that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to create a simple front-end website using React.js or Vue.js and also explore the differences between the two frameworks. We use json-server to create a fake REST API to store the blog posts.

## Folders
- `blogpost-template`: This folder contains html, css files for the blog post template.
- `fronted-react`: This folder contains the React.js project.
- `frontend-vue`: This folder contains the Vue.js project.

## How to run the project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to the `frontend-react` or `frontend-vue` folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `npm run server` to start json-server.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the project.
